# OSS-FFRDC-Maturity
This is a student project created for Carnegie Mellon Univeristy - Intergrated Innovation Institute - Open Source Software to evaluate the maturity of open source software governance practices at Federally Funded Research and Development Centers.

The Name of the FFRDC researched will remain unamed.

Purpose:

Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) are private sector organizations tasked with assisting the U.S. government with long-term research and development. As research matures FFRDCs must open-source software to accelerate the commercialization of technology. Transferring the technology to the public is intended to promote national economic growth while increasing technology development which the U.S. government intends to leverage. As an FFRDC researcher, I have encountered many open source repositories that I would consider to be immature, this presentation will focus on the current maturity level of my organization.

Problem:

Some FFRDC Software Developers are provided limited guidance on how to successfully transition software to the OSS community. Currently, employees are provided with 2 wiki entries primarily focused on release approval (whether a project can be released to the public), licensing options, and access security. Developers are provided access to a PowerPoint presentation from 2014 with some basic open-source information without context, and summary information, and was designed for live presentation delivery not as an instructional aid. The FFRDC GitHub repositories vary in standardization and documentation, with some not explaining what is the software's primary purpose. Currently, the FFRDC does not have an Open Source project office to guide staff.

Goals :

• Determine the need for an Open Source project office. 

• Identify FFRDC OSS established procedures for release, contributions, licensing, management and maintenance. 

• Identify mature Industry OSS established procedures for release, contributions, licensing, management and maintenance. 

• Compare governance with Industry to determine if FFRDC implementation of OSS software is Immature or Mature.

Contribution:

• Develop best practice recommendations intended to improve FFRDC OSS Maturity and share findings with the community.
