This is a student project created for Carnegie Mellon University - Integrated Innovation Institute - Open Source Software to evaluate the maturity of open source software governance practices at Federally Funded Research and Development Centers.

The Name of the FFRDCs researched will remain unnamed.  I do not officially represent an FFRDC about open source, this is a student report and should not be associated with any FFRDC.

Purpose:
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) are private sector organizations tasked with assisting the U.S. government with long-term research and development. As research matures FFRDCs must open-source software to accelerate the commercialization of technology. Transferring the technology to the public is intended to promote national economic growth while increasing technology development which the U.S. government intends to leverage.

Problem:
Some FFRDC Software Developers are provided limited guidance on how to successfully transition software and actively contribute with the OSS community. The FFRDC GitHub repositories vary in standardization and documentation, with some not explaining what is the software's primary purpose. Documentation and educational resources can be hard to find for FFRDC employees as most information available is from a traditional enterprise perspective. How do you release an open-source project? What licensing options do FFRDCs prefer? Will I have to source an alternate code because I have the wrong license? Will my sponsor believe the OSS software is inferior? Do other FFRDC employees feel equally confused?

Solution:
Create collection resources and data points to promote productive conversations designed to prepare FFRDC employees and their organizations.  Survey FFRDC employees to evaluate FFRDC OSS Maturity.  Interview FFRDC employees to better understand their relationship with OSS. Clear up any OSS misinformation that might hinder greater community collaboration and software adoption.

Artificats:
The Report and Presentation are downloadable from this repo.

Wiki:
Contains the orginal survey if you would like to take it yourself.
